Wondering if I could just pick the most interesting cases, not Top10/50 and how to present it then

I'm planning to compare the summons in Manhattan and in NYC in general. I'm not sure should I do graphs showing "Manhattan vs Whole NYC" or "Manhattan vs The Rest of the NYC". What do you think? And should I then adjust the summons to the population? (Although I bet there are lots more of non-Manhattanite cycling in Manhattan than vice versa)
