Wondering if I could just pick the most interesting cases, not Top10/50 and how to present it then

I'm planning to compare the summons in Manhattan and in NYC in general. I'm not sure should I do graphs showing "Manhattan vs Whole NYC" or "Manhattan vs The Rest of the NYC". What do you think? And should I then adjust the summons to the population? (Although I bet there are lots more of non-Manhattanite cycling in Manhattan than vice versa)

I juuuuuuust found the data for the year 2017 so I have to update the first graph, I haven't yet decided wether I'll do it manually or wether I'll do all the data cleaning again for the whole chart.

The problem I'm facing now is, that while it's clear that sidewalk-summons have decreased, I have no idea how they are punished now. I mean, nowadays they are punished, if they are punished, as a moving violations, which is similar to a speeding ticket, and the NYPD are not giving detailed statistics on them. I'm going to ask them, though. But anyway I have to make clear in the graph/story that cycling on the sidewalk still get punished, but in a not so serious way.
